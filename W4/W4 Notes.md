## Primes:
- Are divisible by 1 and itself only.
- `1` is not a prime nor a composite.
- All primes can be represented in a form of $6n Â± 1$, meaning that for any prime `p`, $p \ \%\ 6$ either equals 1 or 5. Except for `2` and `3` 
- If n is a prime number, then for every a, $1 \le a < n$, the following condition hold:
	- $a^{n-1}\ \% \  n = 1$
- A semi-prime number is a product of two prime numbers.
- To check for primarility of `n`: iterate from 2 to $\sqrt{n}$ and check for divisibility. 

## Prime Factorization:
- We can get the product of elements by multiplying their prime factors. Make sense right?
- To check divisibility: get the prime factors of each number, divide and cancel each common factor:
	- if the dividend has more factors than the divisor: `true`
- Raising some number $n$ to a power $k$ is the same as multiplying it's prime factors by $k$. Make sense right?
